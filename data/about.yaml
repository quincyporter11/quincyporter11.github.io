bio: >
  I use this site to share scripts, tools, and experiments from my homelab and
  professional projects. I enjoy building automation with Flask, asyncio, and
  customtkinter, plus working with Cisco ISE, Proxmox, Jellyfin setups,
  TrueNAS, PowerShell, and some Active Directory.

now:
  - Developing a Flask-powered blog to showcase my code projects.
  - Building an Android app with python for tracking blood pressure.
  - Running Jellyfin + TrueNAS with GPU passthrough on Proxmox.
  - Experimenting with Linux ricing.
